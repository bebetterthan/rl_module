# Phase 1B Training Issues & Challenges Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

Training RL agent for intelligent reconnaissance tool selection (3 tools: subfinder, httpx, nmap) with conditional learning capability.

**Goal**: Agent should learn WHEN to use nmap (on infrastructure targets) vs WHEN to skip (on web-only targets).

## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### 1. **Reward Instability & Non-Monotonic Optimization**

**Problem**:

- Increasing rewards does NOT guarantee better performance
- V14 (+10% from V13) → 3976 reward (DOWN 8%)
- V15 (+5% from V13) → 3590 reward (DOWN 17%)
- V16 (strategic boost) → 4025 reward (DOWN 7% from V13)

**Root Cause**:

- RL optimization is **non-convex** and **highly sensitive**
- Small reward changes alter exploration/exploitation balance
- Optimal reward structure found at V13, further changes destabilize

**Evidence**:

```
V13: 4321 reward, 65% nmap, ep_rew_mean 3630
V14: 3976 reward, 70% nmap, ep_rew_mean 3570 (higher nmap hurt!)
V15: 3590 reward, 63% nmap, ep_rew_mean 2320 (catastrophic drop)
V16: 4025 reward, 60% nmap, ep_rew_mean 3910 (best rollout!)
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot predictably improve beyond V13's 4321 reward
- "More reward" optimization strategy counterproductive

---

### 2. **Evaluation vs Rollout Performance Discrepancy**

**Problem**:

- V16 has BEST rollout performance (ep_rew_mean 3910)
- But LOWER final evaluation (4025 vs V13's 4321)
- Training metrics don't predict evaluation performance

**Root Cause**:

- **Stochastic variance** in evaluation scenarios
- **Scenario distribution mismatch** between rollout and eval
- **Policy overfitting** to training distribution

**Evidence**:

```
V13: ep_rew_mean 3630, eval 4321 (ratio: 1.19x)
V16: ep_rew_mean 3910, eval 4025 (ratio: 1.03x)

V16 has BETTER training but WORSE evaluation!
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot reliably select best model based on training metrics
- Need actual test set evaluation to determine true performance

---

### 3. **High Variance in Evaluation Results**

**Problem**:

- All versions have variance >1500
- V13: 1700, V14: 1509, V15: 2004, V16: 1955
- Target variance <200 never achieved

**Root Cause**:

- **Scenario diversity** (web-only vs infrastructure gives very different rewards)
- **Conditional policy** naturally has higher variance
- **Small evaluation set** (20 scenarios) amplifies variance

**Evidence**:

```
V13 Range: 2247 - 7250 (5003 point spread!)
V16 Range: 1944 - 7288 (5344 point spread!)

Web-only scenarios: ~1500-2500 reward
Infrastructure scenarios: ~4000-7000 reward
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot meet variance <200 criterion with current setup
- Variance is **inherent to conditional learning problem**

---

### 4. **Moving Baseline Problem**

**Problem**:

- Baseline performance keeps changing between evaluations
- V13 baseline: 3585
- V14 baseline: 3289
- V16 baseline: 4445 (suddenly 24% higher!)

**Root Cause**:

- Baseline agents (random, hardcoded) evaluated on-the-fly
- **Stochastic environment** causes baseline variance
- No fixed baseline reference

**Evidence**:

```
Same hardcoded agent:
V13 eval: 3289 reward
V14 eval: 3289 reward
V16 eval: 4445 reward (+35%!)

How can same agent get different scores?
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot reliably compare agent performance across versions
- Success criteria (>30% vs baseline) becomes moving target

---

### 5. **Conditional Learning Trade-offs**

**Problem**:

- Higher nmap usage → lower total reward (V14: 70%, 3976 reward)
- Lower nmap usage → also lower reward (V15: 63%, 3590 reward)
- Sweet spot at 65% (V13) hard to maintain

**Root Cause**:

- **Multi-objective optimization** (maximize reward + maintain 50-90% nmap usage)
- **Competing incentives** (web-only skip bonus vs infrastructure use bonus)
- **Exploration-exploitation** dilemma

**Evidence**:

```
V13: 65% nmap, 4321 reward ✅ Sweet spot
V14: 70% nmap, 3976 reward ❌ Too aggressive (includes bad nmap decisions)
V15: 63% nmap, 3590 reward ❌ Too conservative (misses good opportunities)
V16: 60% nmap, 4025 reward ⚠️ Good but not optimal
```

**Impact**:

- Cannot simultaneously maximize both objectives
- Trade-off between reward and nmap usage %

## 🏗️ ENVIRONMENT & MODEL ARCHITECTURE ISSUES

### Environment Design

**FullReconEnv Characteristics**:

```python
State Space: 40 dimensions
  - 8: scenario metadata (port counts, categories)
  - 12: subfinder state (discoveries, progress)
  - 10: httpx state (endpoints, tech)
  - 10: nmap state (ports, services)

Action Space: 10 discrete actions
  - 0-2: subfinder (passive, active, comprehensive)
  - 3-5: httpx (basic, thorough, comprehensive)
  - 6-8: nmap (quick, full, service)
  - 9: skip_nmap (NEW in V8)

Episode: 3 steps (subfinder → httpx → nmap/skip)
```

**Identified Issues**:

1. **Sequential Masking Complexity**

   - Phase 1: Only subfinder actions allowed
   - Phase 2: Only httpx actions allowed
   - Phase 3: Only nmap + skip allowed
   - Agent must learn 3 different policies per phase

2. **Reward Components Interaction**

   ```python
   Total Reward = Discovery + Completion + Strategic + Efficiency

   Problem: Components can conflict!
   - High discovery + skip nmap = good for web-only
   - High strategic + use nmap = good for infrastructure
   - Agent confused when mixed signals
   ```

3. **Scenario Type Classification Ambiguity**

   ```python
   web_only = has_web and not has_infra
   infra_heavy = infra_count >= 2

   Problem: What about scenarios with 1 web + 1 infra?
   - Not web_only (has infra)
   - Not infra_heavy (only 1 infra)
   - Falls through cracks! → No strategic bonus
   ```

4. **Coverage Calculation Issues**

   ```python
   def _calculate_coverage(self):
       subdomain_coverage = discovered / total
       endpoint_coverage = discovered / total
       port_coverage = discovered / total
       return (subdomain + endpoint + port) / 3

   Problem: Assumes equal importance!
   - 1 critical service = 10 subdomains?
   - Doesn't reflect actual reconnaissance value
   ```

### Model Architecture

**PPO Configuration**:

```python
Algorithm: PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
Learning Rate: 1e-3
Entropy Coefficient: 0.05
Batch Size: 128
Total Timesteps: 300,000
```

**Identified Issues**:

1. **Learning Rate Too High?**

   - 1e-3 is aggressive for RL
   - May cause instability after initial convergence
   - Could explain V14-V16 regressions

2. **Entropy Coefficient Impact**

   - 0.05 encourages exploration
   - May prevent full convergence
   - Final entropy_loss: -0.3 to -0.5 (not fully deterministic)

3. **Training Length Insufficient?**

   - 300k steps = ~9 minutes training
   - Converged? Or just stopped early?
   - Longer training might help stability

4. **No Curriculum Learning**
   - Agent sees all scenario types from start
   - Could benefit from progressive difficulty
   - Start with clear cases, add ambiguous later

## 🔬 REWARD ENGINEERING CHALLENGES

### Evolution of Reward Structure

**Discovery Rewards Scaling**:

```python
# Original (V1-V7):
subdomains: 15
endpoints: 10
infra_ports: 30
web_ports: 10

# V11 (1.8x amplification):
subdomains: 36
endpoints: 27
infra_ports: 54
web_ports: 18

# V13 (2.16x - BEST):
subdomains: 43
endpoints: 32
infra_ports: 65
web_ports: 22

# V14 (2.38x - TOO MUCH):
subdomains: 47
endpoints: 35
infra_ports: 72
web_ports: 24
```

**Strategic Bonuses Evolution**:

```python
# Infrastructure 3-tool workflow:
V10: 900
V11: 1620
V12: 2000
V13: 2000 (kept)
V14: 2300
V16: 2600

# Web-only skip bonus:
V10: 700
V11: 1260
V12: 1000 (reduced to balance)
V13-V16: 1000 (stable)
```

**Key Findings**:

1. **Diminishing Returns**

   - V13 at 2.16x scaling is optimal
   - Further amplification (V14: 2.38x) hurts performance
   - Non-linear relationship between reward scale and agent performance

2. **Balance is Critical**

   ```
   Infrastructure Use / Web-only Skip ratio:
   V12: 5048 / 194 = 26:1 ✅
   V13: 5470 / 208 = 26:1 ✅ (maintained)
   V14: 5988 / 238 = 25:1 ✅
   V16: 6022 / 208 = 29:1 ✅

   All maintain strong signal, yet performance varies!
   ```

3. **Ratio Alone Insufficient**
   - Even with correct ratio, performance differs
   - Absolute reward values matter
   - Interaction effects between components

## 🐛 TECHNICAL BUGS ENCOUNTERED

### 1. Missing Tracking Keys (V1-V5)

```python
# Bug: info dict didn't have 'nmap_used' key
# Training script expected it for logging
# Result: Reported 0% nmap usage (false negative)

# Fix: Added all tracking keys at episode termination
info = {
    'nmap_used': self.tools_used['nmap']['used'],
    'nmap_mode': self.tools_used['nmap']['mode'],
    # ... etc
}
```

### 2. Forced Nmap Workflow (V6-V7)

```python
# Bug: Phase 2 action mask only allowed nmap
mask = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]  # Only actions 6-8 (nmap)

# No option to skip! Agent forced to use nmap 100%
# Result: 100% nmap usage, no conditional learning

# Fix: Added action 9 (skip_nmap)
self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(10)  # Was 9
mask = [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]  # Include skip
```

### 3. Reward Ceiling Too Low (V10)

```python
# Problem: Maximum possible reward only ~1165
# Target: >2079 (30% above baseline)
# Mathematical impossibility!

# Analysis:
Web-only max: 973 (discovery) + 1000 (skip) = 1973
Infrastructure max: 1600 (discovery) + 3600 (strategic) = 5200

# Average: (1973 * 9 + 5200 * 11) / 20 = 3751
# But target was 2079 (incorrect baseline calculation)

# Fix: Amplified all rewards by 1.8x
```

### 4. Type Errors in Logging

```python
# Various TypeErrors during evaluation:
# - NoneType not subscriptable (current_scenario)
# - Cannot convert string to float
# - Division by zero in coverage calculation

# Fixed with proper null checks and defaults
```
